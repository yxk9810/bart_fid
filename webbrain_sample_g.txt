he is trying to get roar back on track . norrca is run by mr. j.r. sitman of california . he casts norrca as the organization that cares about racers , in contrast to roar which ( in this view ) cares more about equipment manufacturers and their financial well-being . certainly norrca has been more innovative than roar over the past several years . norrca has created racing classes that separate pro drivers from the average guy , and recently has experimented with tire limits at major events to hold down costs . norrca 's national championship events are considered less important that roar 's national championships , but major teams contest them both . 1.9 ) what 's the difference between stock and modified classes ?[SPLIT] national organization for racing radio controlled autos was one of two premier sanctioning bodies for radio-controlled racing in north america along with remotely operated auto racers  [1][2]   and at the time, the largest [3]   boasting of 14,000 members according to the los angeles times in 1994, despite a decline in participation by 40%. [4]   in 2002, the new york times claimed membership at 17,000. [1]  the sanctioning body was established in september 1987 by j. r. sitman of california, who created the organization with the emphasis on the racers as in contrast to the well-off equipment manufacturers; [5]   unlike roar, norrca also organized races. [0]   roar members were offered first-year discount membership. [2]  norrca was known for many innovations brought into racing such as its creation of racing classes that kept professional drivers away from the less well-off amateur racers and introduced tire limits at major events to keep costs down. despite its national championship being not as prestigious as that of roar's, largely as the latter is an international federation of model auto racing member bloc, which earns entry rights to its world championships, major factory teams compete in both regardless.

[0]   according to another definition it is a system of measurement that begins at a minimum, or zero point, and progresses in only one direction. [1]   yet another definition tells us it the count of the elements in a set, with its natural origin being zero, the empty set. [2]   some sources tell us that even time can be measured in an absolute scale, proving year zero is measured from the beginning of the universe. [3]   how that is obtained precisely would be a matter of debate. the most accepted absolute scale is the kelvin temperature scale, where absolute zero is the temperature at which molecular energy is at a minimum.

[5]  the pike is intended to be more accurate with a longer range than rocket propelled grenades and standard rifle grenades, while being far lighter and more cost-effective than current infantry guided weapons like the $78,000 each fgm-148 javelin . further improvements could include different fuses, multiple-round simultaneous programming and targeting with data-link capabilities, and platform integration onto small boats, vehicles, and small unmanned aerial vehicles . [2][4][5]  pike weighs 1.7 lb (0.77 kg) and is 16.8 in (43 cm) long, too long to fit in the breech of the m203 grenade launcher . at ausa 2015, raytheon revealed they had performed two successful test firings of the pike. [2][3][4][5]  after its unveiling, raytheon received permission to market the pike to foreign governments, several of which have shown interest for infantry forces and special operators. while it is more expensive than unguided rpgs and less powerful than a javelin, it is cheaper than anti-tank missiles and powerful enough to blast through walls and other barriers.

( mel melcon / los angeles times ) by samantha bonar facebook twitter linkedin email copy link url copied ! print in the midst of a cucumber recall that has sickened hundreds in 30 states , the food and drug administration today finalized the first two of seven major rules under the food safety modernization act meant to beef up the country ’ s food safety system . the rules put in place today — the preventive controls rules — aim to hold imported food to the same safety standards as domestically produced food , and seek to develop a nationally integrated food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities the fda hasn ’ t forgotten about our animal friends either — the rules finalized today focus on implementing modern food manufacturing processes for both human and animal foods . perhaps most significantly , the goal of the new rules is a proactive food-safety system : to prevent hazards to customers on the front end , rather than waiting to act until an outbreak has occurred . advertisement an estimated 48 million people ( 1 in 6 americans ) get sick each year from foodborne diseases , according to recent data from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention .[SPLIT][title] Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls [ref] [2]"First FSMA Rules Finalized by FDA" email written by scott horsfall today two key elements of the long-anticipated food safety modernization act became final . with their publication in the federal register , the rules covering preventive controls for human food and the preventive controls for foods for animals are now laws – although actual compliance dates will range from one to three years , depending on the size of the operation . for many in the leafy greens industry , the preventive controls for human food rule will be of significant interest . much of what is in the final rule reflects earlier draft versions : facilities ( not farms – these will be covered under the still-to-be-published produce rule ) “ must establish and implement a food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and risk-based preventive controls. ” specific requirements are spelled out in the rule itself . in the final rule , the fda has responded to many of the comments provided by industry during the comment period on these rules . of particular note , many of the definitions for things like a “ farm ” or a “ mixed type facility ” appear to have been improved in the final version of the preventive practices rule . earlier versions had concerned the industry because they didn ’ t accurately reflect modern farming practices . we expect these changes in definitions to be consistent in the other rules – particularly the produce rule – as they are finalized .[SPLIT][title] Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls [ref] [3]"FDA Issues Final Rules on Produce Safety, Imported Foods" the changes are part of the 2011 food safety modernization act , or fsma , a sweeping package of food safety reforms governing produce safety , preventive controls for food produced in facilities , and the safety of imported food . “ the recent multistate outbreak of salmonella in imported cucumbers that has killed four americans , hospitalized 157 and sickened hundreds more , is exactly the kind of outbreak these rules can help prevent , ” michael taylor , fda deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine , said in a statement . the produce safety rule includes requirements for water quality , employee health and hygiene , wild and domesticated animals , compost and manure , and equipment , tools , and buildings . the final rule includes public comments and input from hundreds of farm visits and meetings with stakeholders , the fda said . under the new foreign supplier verification rule , food importers will be required to verify that suppliers are producing food that meets u.s. safety standards . the fda also issued guidelines governing the accreditation of third-party auditors to conduct food safety audits on foreign food facilities . in 2013 , the usda estimated that imported food accounted for 19 percent of the u.s. food supply , including 52 percent of fresh fruits and 22 percent of fresh vegetables . in a conference call , taylor said he is confident that the new rules will improve food safety , but said success is contingent on full funding of president barack obama ’ s 2016 budget request .[SPLIT][title] Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls [ref] [4]FR both proposed and final government rules are

rule will be discussed . the public comments are considered by the issuing government agency , and the text of a final rule along with a discussion of the comments is published in the federal register . any agency proposing a rule in the federal register must provide contact information for people and organizations interested in making comments to the agencies and the agencies are required to address these concerns when it publishes its final rule on the subject . the notice and comment process , as outlined in the administrative procedure act , gives the people a chance to participate in agency rulemaking . publication of documents in the federal register also constitutes constructive notice , and its contents are judicially noticed . the united states government manual is published

[2]  playing a 200-foot game means fighting for each part of the ice, fighting for control of the puck whether it's in one's possession or not, and engaging using your body in traffic. classic examples of players who exemplify the 200-foot player include gordie howe , bryan trottier , jari kurri , steve yzerman , patrice bergeron , doug gilmour , pavel datsyuk , mike modano , bobby clarke , sergei fedorov , joe sakic , anže kopitar , bob gainey , frank nighbor and sidney crosby .

[1]   bundling is the setting of the total price of a purchase of several products or services over a period from one seller at a lower level than the sum of the prices of the products or services purchased separately from several sellers over the period. typically, one of the bundled items (the "primary product" or "monopoly product" or "non-contestable product") is available only from the seller engaging in the bundling, while the other item or items (the "secondary product" or "contestable product") can be obtained from several sellers. [2]   the effect of the bundling is to divert purchasers who need the primary product to the bundling seller and away from other sellers of only the secondary product. for that reason, the practice may be held an antitrust violation as it was in the lepage's case, in which the third circuit held that 3m engaged in monopolization in violation of sherman act § 2 by offering rebates to customers conditioned on purchases spanning six of 3m's different product lines, and entering into contracts that expressly or effectively required dealing exclusively with 3m.

[5]   as a result, they decided instead to create a 3d computer-generated character who could perform the songs. [0]  the hartmanns developed t-babe over the course of a year. [0]   initially, her purpose was to attract further attention to the label from the rest of the music industry, but the couple soon began to treat the character as an artist in her own right. [0]   tessa met with a number of focus groups to develop t-babe's personality and to make the character relatable. [0]   she created a five-year timeline for t-babe, including events such as when her hair would grow and when she would have boyfriend problems. [0]   it was decided that t-babe would be 18-years-old, single, lonely, fluent in german, spanish, italian and japanese, and "a big fan of shopping [and] athletics". [0]   the t in her name stood for saint teresa ,    and her parents were a university professor and an ex-hippy. [0]   the singing voice for t-babe was supplied by an american singer who chose to remain anonymous, as she was already an established singer. [0]  t-babe was first previewed in 2000 at the music festival midem in cannes , where glasgow records formed part of the british phonographic industry 's stall. [0]   she gave her first tv interview in march 2000 with matthew price for the children's news programme newsround . [0]   her debut single, "peter pumpkineater", was originally slated for release that month,    but was instead pushed back to september. [0]   in may of that year, t-babe was featured in the magazine vogue and was offered a contract with the fashion designer louis vuitton . [citation needed ] she later appeared on the american broadcasting company 's programme good morning america , and was also named "most beautiful new pop artist" by the italian version of cosmopolitan and "it cyber pin-up of the year" by entertainment weekly . [4]   during this promotion, commentators compared t-babe with similar computer-generated/animated characters of the time, such as gorillaz , lara croft , kyoko date , ananova and germany's e-cyas. [5][5]  in may 2000, the hartmanns launched glasgow animation, a sister company their record label that would develop t-babe further. they sought to raise £5 million in private equity for the development, and hired benfield advisory from the city of london to assist in raising the funds. [0]  they received a £10 million offer from a public company, but turned it down. [0]   silicon graphics provided sponsorship to the company, and supplied graphics software used to develop the character. [0]  "peter pumpkineater" was eventually released on 15 march 2001,    but failed to make the uk's top 100 chart.

[0]   humans spend about two hours dreaming per night, [5]   and each dream lasts around 5 to 20 minutes. [0]  the content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history . dream interpretation , practiced by the babylonians in the third millennium bce    and even earlier by the ancient sumerians,    figures prominently in religious texts in several traditions, and has played a lead role in psychotherapy. [0]   the scientific study of dreams is called oneirology . [0]   most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function. it is not known where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.the human dream experience and what to make of it have undergone sizable shifts over the course of history. [1]   long ago, according to writings from mesopotamia and ancient egypt , dreams dictated post-dream behaviors to an extent sharply reduced in later millennia. these ancient writings about dreams highlight visitation dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific actions and may predict future events. [5]   the brain activity capable of formulating such dreams, rare among literate people in later eras, conforms to the bicameral mentality hypothesized by julian jaynes as dominant into the second or first millennium bce. framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time.dreaming and sleep are intertwined. [0]  dreams occur mainly in the rapid-eye movement stage of sleep —when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. because rem sleep is detectable in many species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience rem, [3]   linking dreams to rem sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream. however, humans dream during non-rem sleep, also, and not all rem awakenings elicit dream reports. [4]   to be studied, a dream must first be reduced to a verbal report, which is an account of the subject's memory of the dream, not the subject's dream experience itself. so, dreaming by non-humans is currently unprovable, as is dreaming by human fetuses and pre-verbal infants.

[0]  the jews of yemen, maintaining strict adherence to talmudic and maimonidean halakha , observed the gezeirah which prohibited playing    musical instruments, [1]   and "instead of developing the playing of musical instruments, they perfected singing and rhythm. "    (for the modern yemenite-israeli musical phenomenon see yemenite jewish music .) this arrangement was integrated into the walks of life familiar to the jews of yemen. the texts used in the arrangement were put down in writing and later    included in separate song collections . the social strictures and norms in yemenite jewish culture provide for separate settings for men and for women, where the sexes are never mixed. [0]  men’s song usually expressed the national aspirations of the jewish people, [2]   and it was far removed from the singing associated with the muslim environment, whereas folk songs of jewish women were sung by rote memory (unwritten poetry) and expressed the happiness and sorrows inherent in their daily life and was, as a rule, closer to that of muslim women.

[1]  because very little energy is needed to excite electrons in an sgs, charge concentrations are very easily ‘tuneable’. for example, this can be done by introducing a new element or by application of a magnetic or electric field .a new type of sgs identified in 2017, known as dirac-type linear spin-gapless semiconductors, has linear dispersion and is considered an ideal platform for massless and dissipationless spintronics because spin-orbital coupling opens a gap for the spin fully polarized conduction and valence band, and as a result, the interior of the sample becomes an insulator, however, an electrical current can flow without resistance at the sample edge. [1]  this effect, the quantum anomalous hall effect has only previously been realised in magnetically doped topological insulators. [1]  as well as dirac/linear sgss, the other major category of sgs are parabolic spin gapless semiconductors. [2][3]  electron mobility in such materials is two to four orders of magnitude higher than in classical semiconductors. [4]  sgss are topologically non-trivial . [2]

domain `` the termres publicae referred to things that were shared by all citizens , and the term res universitatis meant things that were owned by the municipalities of rome.when looking at it from a

the first early copyright law was originally established in britain with the statute of anne in 1710 , public domain did not appear . however , similar concepts were developed by british and french jurists in the 18th century . instead of `` public domain '' , they used terms such as publici juris or propriété publique to describe works that were not covered by copyright law . the phrase `` fall in the public domain '' can be traced to mid-19th-century france to describe the end of copyright term . the french poet alfred de vigny equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling `` into the sink hole of public domain '' and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual

” the answer was lico . but the mountain ’ s formidable geography – its circling rock wall rises 700 metres above the plain – raised a whole new series of questions in terms of accessibility . bayliss decided to focus on a “ shorter ” cliff of about 125 metres on one side , and to put together an expedition that would place scientists on the top of lico via that vertical rock . but how would they be able to get up there ?[SPLIT][title] Mount Lico [ref] [4]"Secrets revealed: Researchers explore unique, isolated forest in Mozambique" but a tract of undisturbed forest has recently been discovered and surveyed in the country ’ s zambezia province – hidden in plain site at the top of a mountain . julian bayliss , a conservation scientist , initially spotted the forest on google earth . this isn ’ t the first time he ’ s done so ; in 2005 , he used the platform to identify an unexplored rainforest on mozambique ’ s mount mabu . to confirm the presence of this newest forest , bayliss traveled to the base of mount lico and flew a drone to the top of it . then , in may , bayliss and a team of more than two-dozen scientists and other experts set out on an expedition to see what kinds of animals and plants lived in this island in the sky . up they went , using ropes and quickly learned rock-climbing techniques to hoist themselves and their equipment up the 410-foot sheer cliffs . bayliss was the first to reach the top . as he waited for the rest of his team , he looked around and was filled with an “ immense sense of wonder and excitement. ” “ the first thing that struck me was just how quiet the forest was , ” he told mongabay . “ however , there were signs of many animal tracks in the undergrowth which was very exciting .[SPLIT][title] Mount Lico [ref] [5]"The Secret Garden: How Google Earth led a team of scientists to discover an untouched mountaintop rainforest" if you buy something from a verge link , vox media may earn a commission . see our ethics statement . share this story all sharing options for : the secret garden in 2018 , what is left to explore in the world ?

[0]  the forest on top, within a volcanic crater, covers only about 30 hectares (74 acres). in 2012 mt lico was "discovered", or more correctly, identified as a place of special scientific interest, by julian bayliss [1][2]   of oxford brookes university , who had earlier similarly identified mount mabu some 70 kilometres (43 miles) southwest, by using google earth to search for significant landforms and vegetation features. [3][4]  in may 2018, bayliss led a multidisciplinary expedition to scale the sheer walls of mount lico and begin the study of its unique habitat. [5]   although it had been considered unlikely that humans would have entered the mountain's forest prior to this expedition, evidence of some limited human visitation was discovered in the form of several pots which had been placed, possibly for religious reasons, at the source of a stream on the mountain top.

spotlight for its policy surrounding festivals over the past months , with a number of young people overdosing on substances while attending events over the summer months , resulting in numerous hospitalisations and deaths . nsw premier gladys berejiklian announced in october that her government would introduce a tough new law to target and punish dealers who caused deaths , which meant they could be jailed for 25 years . ms berejiklian also flagged in october that the government would be introducing tougher licensing provisions for festivals . changes to the law reportedly include a ‘ user-pays ’ model with a price per ticket imposed on punters.source : facebook three different nsw festivals have already announced cancellations or planned cancellations this year.source : facebook the new changes will see festival organisers now defined by a highly detailed “ risk matrix ” , which categorises different festivals and exposes them to different types of mandatory charges for services deemed necessary to the new licences . these new licences could cost festival organises hundreds of thousands of dollars .[SPLIT] don't kill live music australia was a campaign against the new south wales state government , demanding changes to regulations that directly impact music festivals within the state. [1]   the campaign saw the establishment of an official petition with over 110,000 signatures [2]   as well as an organised rally with an estimated 30,000 protestors [3]   which was held on 21 february 2019, at sydney, australia ’s hyde park .concern was caused by sudden regulation and policy changes that could negatively affect festival organisers and the future of some music festivals. [4]   the state government and new south wales premier, gladys berejiklian , deemed regulations surrounding festivals and drug dealers at the 'high risk' events inadequate. this resulted in the implementation of tougher licensing policies for music festivals. [5]   the don't kill live music campaign was then initiated to ensure that the regulatory changes would not negatively impact the future of music festival and instead suggest the formation of a review board for any regulations that deal with festivals. [0]  the political tension created by the campaign was leading up to the 2019 nsw state elections    in which several don't kill live music supporters wanted to elect a new parliament that would support the re-regulation of music festivals and increased transparency as suggested by the petition demands. [0]   however, the election day, 23 march 2019, saw gladys berejiklian elected as new south wales' third female elected premier which lead to the inactivity of the don't kill live music australia campaign.

[1]   the mixer is plugged into a pa system for live events and/or broadcasting equipment (if the dj is performing on radio, tv or internet radio ) so that a wider audience can hear the turntablist's music. turntablists manipulate records on a turntable by moving the record with their hand to cue the stylus to exact points on a record, and by touching or moving the platter or record to stop, slow down, speed up or, spin the record backwards, or moving the turntable platter back and forth (the popular rhythmic "scratching " effect which is a key part of hip hop music ), [2]   all while using a dj mixer 's crossfader control and the mixer's gain and equalization controls to adjust the sound and level of each turntable. turntablists typically use two or more turntables and headphones to cue up desired start points on different records (greasley & prior, 2013).turntablists, who are often called djs (or "deejays"), generally prefer direct-drive turntables over belt-driven or other types, because the belt can be stretched or damaged by "scratching" and other turntable manipulation such as slowing down a record, whereas a direct drive turntable can be stopped, slowed down, or spun backwards without damaging the electric motor. [0]  the word turntablist was originated by luis "dj disk " quintanilla (primus , herbie hancock , invisibl skratch piklz ). [3]   after a phone conversation with disk, it was later popularised in 1995 by dj babu     to describe the difference between a dj who simply plays and mixes records and one who performs by physically manipulating the records, stylus, turntables, turntable speed controls and mixer to produce new sounds. the new term coincided with the resurgence of hip-hop djing in the 1990s.john oswald described the art: "a phonograph in the hands of a 'hiphop/scratch' artist who plays a record like an electronic washboard with a phonographic needle as a plectrum , produces sounds which are unique and not reproduced—the record player becomes a musical instrument. [4]  " [4]   some turntablists use turntable techniques like beat mixing/matching , scratching , and beat juggling . some turntablists seek to have themselves recognized as traditional musicians capable of interacting and improvising with other performers.

a self-published parody of erotic dinosaur fiction called space raptor butt invasion , by chuck tingle ; and my little pony cartoon the cutie map . since 2013 , the sad puppies has posted recommendations of works to combat the hugo tendency to reward works that writer brad torgersen deemed “ niche , academic , overtly to the left in ideology and flavour , and ultimately lacking what might best be called visceral , gut-level , swashbuckling fun ” . supporters are encouraged to buy memberships to the annual world science fiction convention , which enables them to nominate works chosen by the campaign and vote on the final selection for the hugo awards .[SPLIT][title] Sad Puppies [ref] [3]"Hijacking the Hugo Awards Won't Stifle Diversity in Science Fiction" the prizes have been targeted by voting blocks opposed to progressive efforts to recognize more women and writers of color . but trying to undo change in an increasingly diverse world is futile . by kameron hurley suzanne plunkett/reuters april 9 , 2015 share the science-fiction and fantasy literature world might seem by its nature to be forward-thinking , but it has n't been free from the kinds of culture wars embodied by last year 's gamergate controversy—a fact aptly illustrated by this year ’ s nominations for the genre ’ s most prestigious awards , the hugos . the tastes of the voting audience for the hugos ( comprised of the attendees of the world science fiction convention , or worldcon ) seem to have grown more diverse in recent years . and their selections have reflected that : last year 's awards were swept by writers of color and women , myself included . so it was a surprise when a majority of voters woke up april 4 to a nomination slate almost exclusively overrun by novels , stories , and related fan efforts promoted by a small group of writers who claim the hugos are turning into affirmative-action awards catering to left-wing ideologies .[SPLIT][title] Sad Puppies [ref] [4]"Sci-Fi Fandom Declares Victory After Reactionary Nominees Lose Big at the Hugos" “ i stand with marginalized groups who seek merely to be seen as fully human , ” mixon said before leaving the stage . “ black lives matter. ” the fans rejected the puppies every time there was an alternative to choose from . in several categories , however , all nominees were from the puppies ’ slates . there was only one alternative to voting for the puppies : voting “ no award. ” since the first hugo awards in 1953 , there had only been five instances of “ no award ” actually winning a category . on saturday , voters doubled that total in one night , refusing to elevate any nominee in an astonishing five categories , all of which were composed entirely of puppy selections . the most controversial instances of “ no award ” came in the important categories of “ best editor ” for both short-form and long-form . while all the editors nominated were on the puppy slates , many of their contemporaries felt that most of the choices were deserving ones , despite the puppies ’ endorsements . “ it would be a tragedy if we threw out four good editors just because the puppies like them too , ” wrote a game of thrones author george r. r. martin before the convention , referring to the long-form category . but that ’ s exactly what the voters did .[SPLIT][title] Sad Puppies [ref][SPLIT] sad puppies was an unsuccessful [1]   right-wing [2]   anti-diversity [3]   voting campaign run from 2013 to 2017 and intended to influence the outcome of the annual hugo awards , the longest-running prize (since 1953) for science fiction or fantasy works. it was started in 2013 by author larry correia as a voting bloc to get his novel monster hunter legion nominated for a hugo award, and then grew into suggested slates , or sets of works to nominate, in subsequent years (led by correia in 2014, and then brad r. torgersen in 2015).for the 2015 hugos, the sad puppies slate and overlapping rabid puppies slate, run by vox day , swept several entire categories of nominations. [4]  during final voting at the hugos, however, all except one of those categories was voted "no award"; in that category, best film , the puppies nominated already-popular films. [4]   in the following year, the sad puppies campaign was changed to use ranked recommendation lists rather than a slate, though the rabid puppy campaign did not follow suit. only two categories were swept by the campaigns and subsequently voted for "no award", and the only puppy nominees to win categories were ones by popular creators unconnected to the campaigns, such as neil gaiman . [0]  the sad puppy campaign did not return in 2017, and the rabid puppy campaign only mustered an estimated 80–90 members and 12 nominations. that year, the nominating rules for the hugos were changed to limit the power of bloc voting for small sets of works.

[title] Racial battle fatigue [ref] [1]S2CID further development of such services is planned . other registries include crossref and the multilingual european doi registration agency.since 2015 , rfcs can be referenced as doi:10.17487/rfc .... features and benefits [ edit ] the idf designed the doi system to provide a form of persistent identification , in which each doi name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated ( although when the publisher of a journal changes , sometimes all the dois will be changed , with the old dois no longer working ) . it also associates metadata with objects , allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships . included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow doi names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found . to achieve its goals , the doi system combines the handle system and the indecs content model with a social infrastructure . the handle system ensures that the doi name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership , that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its doi name , and that no two objects are assigned the same doi name . because doi names are short character strings , they are human-readable , may be copied and pasted as text , and fit into the uri specification .[SPLIT][title] Racial battle fatigue [ref] [2]"Microaggression and racial battle fatigue" with the surge in hate incidents across the country following the 2016 election , campus communities need to understand and address acts of aggression—especially microaggressions—and acknowledge the “ racial battle fatigue ” many people may be experiencing , according to william a. smith , associate professor in the department of education , culture & society and the division of ethnic studies . “ what we have to do is recognize that these things have been going on and this election only made the larger society and our campuses start to recognize what has already been part of the experiences of people of color on college campuses , ” said smith , who coined the term “ racial battle fatigue ” in 2003. he has written extensively about microaggression experienced by black faculty and students , including being the lead author of a study published in september in the international journal of qualitative studies in education . the new study looked at experiences of black male students on historically white university and college campuses . microaggressions are subtle , cumulative verbal and nonverbal acts ranging from slights to insults and stigmatizations that target race , gender , class , religion , ability , sexual orientation , class and other minority statuses . while such acts may be intentional , often those who engage in these behaviors are unaware of their stereotypical and hurtful nature .[SPLIT][title] Racial battle fatigue [ref] [3]ISSN the international doi foundation oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure . the social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering doi services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as gs1 and isbn . comparison with other identifier schemes [ edit ] a doi name differs from commonly used internet pointers to material , such as the uniform resource locator , in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity , rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time . it implements the uniform resource identifier ( uniform resource name ) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure . a doi name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the isbn , isrc , etc . the purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers , whereas the primary purpose of the doi system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable , where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections . the doi system offers persistent , semantically interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner ( e.g. , public citation or managing content of value ) . it uses a managed registry ( providing social and technical infrastructure )

[1]   it was introduced by william a. smith, a professor in the division of ethnic studies and department of education, culture, and society at the university of utah . [2]   the framework offers a lens to better understand racial undertones of a campus environment and educational experiences for people of color , smith's research originated on black faculty, both men and women, and then black college students, prior to a more focused examination on african american men. since this earlier period of research, racial battle fatigue scholarship has been used to include other racially minoritized groups. [3][4]  the phenomenon builds on existing research connecting african americans and other people of color with oppression and discrimination experienced at historically white institutions. [3][4]   smith incorporates literature on combat trauma and combat stress syndrome to help understand the effects of managing hostile environments and persistent extreme stress. [1]

28-6 in a nine-inning game . the nashville american reported on vanderbilt : the vanderbilt boys put up a good game , taking everything into consideration , and the best judges of the sport who witnessed the game say it was played well . the college boys did not have their regular team out yesterday because several of their best men were injured during their southern tour last week . the

[title] Public choice [ref] [1]The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics rent seeking , according to public choice theory , is securing profits through the political process rather than the market process of exchange . an example of rent seeking is when a firm , union , or special-interest group lobbies political actors ( e.g . politicians or bureaucrats ) to influence legislation in a beneficial manner . this can lead to moral hazard when politicians make policy decisions based on the lobby instead of the efficiency of the policy . tullock also formulated and considered the tullock paradox , namely , the paradox of why rent-seeking is so cheap . tullock 's spike [ edit ] the name `` tullock 's spike '' refers to a thought experiment in which tullock suggested that if governments were serious about reducing road casualties , they should mandate that a sharp spike be installed in the center of each car 's steering wheel , to increase the probability that an accident would be fatal to the driver . tullock 's idea was that the normal process of risk compensation would then lead to safer driving by the affected drivers , thereby actually reducing driving fatalities . awards and recognition [ edit ] in 1994 tullock was awarded an honorary ph.d. from the university of chicago and in 1998 became a distinguished fellow of the american economic association . he served as president of the southern economic association , the international atlantic economic society , the western economic association and the public choice society .[SPLIT][title] Public choice [ref] [2]"The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1986" the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel 1986 was awarded to james m. buchanan jr. `` for his development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making .

[1]   its content includes the study of political behavior . in political science, it is the subset of positive political theory that studies self-interested agents (voters, politicians, bureaucrats) and their interactions, which can be represented in a number of ways – using (for example) standard constrained utility maximization, game theory , or decision theory . [1]   it is the origin and intellectual foundation of contemporary work in political economy. [0]  in popular use, "public choice" is often used as a shorthand for components of modern public choice theory that focus on the ways in which elected officials, bureaucrats and other government agents can be influenced by their own perceived self-interest when making decisions in their official roles. after james m. buchanan received the 1986 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences "for his development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making" in this space, bbc journalist alistair cooke explained the award, "public choice rests on the homely but important observation that politicians are, after all, no different than the rest of us. [3]  " [2][3]  public choice analysis has roots in positive analysis ("what is") but is often used for normative purposes ("what ought to be") in order to identify a problem or to suggest improvements to constitutional rules (i.e., constitutional economics ). [1][4]  public choice theory is also closely related to social choice theory , a mathematical approach to aggregation of individual interests, welfares, or votes. [5]   much early work had aspects of both, and both fields use the tools of economics and game theory . since voter behavior influences the behavior of public officials, public-choice theory often uses results from social-choice theory. [0]  general treatments of public choice may also be classified under public economics . [0]  public choice, building upon economic theory, has some core tenets that are largely adhered to. the first is the use of the individual as the common decision unit. [0]  due to this there is no decision made by an aggregate whole. rather, decisions are made by the combined choices of the individuals. [0]  the second is the use of markets in the political system, which was argued to be a return to true economics. [0]   the final is the self-interested nature of all individuals within the political system. however, as buchanan and tullock argued, "the ultimate defense of the economic-individualist behavioral assumption must be empirical...the only final test of a model lies in its ability to assist in understanding real phenomena"

[1]   in 1643 he charted the west coast of the north island, his expedition then sailed back to batavia without setting foot on new zealand soil. british explorer james cook , who reached new zealand in october 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first european to circumnavigate and map new zealand. [2]   from the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers.in 1840 the treaty of waitangi was signed between representatives of the united kingdom and various māori chiefs , bringing new zealand into the british empire and giving māori the same rights as british subjects. disputes over the differing translations of the treaty and settler desire to acquire land from māori led to the new zealand wars from 1843. there was extensive british settlement throughout the rest of the 19th century and into the early part of the next century. [0]  the effects of european infectious diseases, [3]   the new zealand wars and the imposition of a european economic and legal system led to most of new zealand's land passing from māori to pākehā ownership, and māori became impoverished.the colony gained responsible government in the 1850s. from the 1890s the new zealand parliament enacted a number of progressive initiatives, including women's suffrage and old age pensions . [0]  after becoming a self-governing dominion with the british empire in 1907, the country remained an enthusiastic member of the empire, and over 100,000 new zealanders fought in world war i as part of the new zealand expeditionary force . after the war, new zealand signed the treaty of versailles , joined the league of nations , and pursued an independent foreign policy, while its defence was still controlled by britain. [0]  when world war ii broke out in 1939, new zealand contributed to the defence of britain and the pacific war ; the country contributed some 120,000 troops. from the 1930s the economy was highly regulated and an extensive welfare state was developed. [0]  from the 1950s māori began moving to the cities in large numbers, and māori culture underwent a renaissance . this led to the development of a māori protest movement which in turn led to greater recognition of the treaty of waitangi in the late 20th century.the country's economy suffered in the aftermath of the 1973 global energy crisis , the loss of new zealand's biggest export market upon britain's entry to the european economic community , and rampant inflation.

[1]   like some other species in the family blechnaceae , it has two types of leaves. the sterile leaves have flat, wavy-margined leaflets 5 to 8 millimeters wide, while the fertile leaves have much narrower leaflets, each with two thick rows of sori on the underside. [3]  the latin specific epithet spicant is of uncertain origin, possibly referring to a tufted or spiky habit. [0]  s. spicant is hardy down to −20 °c (−4 °f) and evergreen , growing to 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in). [0]   it has gained the royal horticultural society 's award of garden merit . [4]  the species was first described in 1753 by carl linnaeus as osmunda spicant. it has been placed in a wide range of genera, including blechnum (as blechnum spicant). [1]   in the pteridophyte phylogeny group classification of 2016 (ppg i), it is placed in the genus struthiopteris , in the subfamily blechnoideae. [5]

[0]  computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics ), astrophysics , climatology , chemistry , biology and manufacturing , as well as human systems in economics , psychology , social science , health care and engineering . simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. [0]  it can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions . [0]  computer simulations are realized by running computer programs that can be either small, running almost instantly on small devices, or large-scale programs that run for hours or days on network-based groups of computers. the scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. [1]  in 1997, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around kuwait , using multiple supercomputers in the dod high performance computer modernization program. [1]  other examples include a 1-billion-atom model of material deformation; [2]   a 2 model of the complex protein-producing organelle of all living organisms, the ribosome , in 2005; [3]  a complete simulation of the life cycle of mycoplasma genitalium in 2012; and the blue brain project at epfl , begun in may 2005 to create the first computer simulation of the entire human brain, right down to the molecular level. [4]  because of the computational cost of simulation, computer experiments are used to perform inference such as uncertainty quantification . [0]

[0]   it differed from the unified patent court agreement in that the epla negotiations were coordinated from the side of the european patent office, rather than from the european council and commission    and therefore also offered the possibility for non-eu states to participate. the epla was a proposed alternative to a set of proposed community patent regulations. [0]   the european commission regarded the negotiations on the epla as unlawful,    although in 2006 it had gained a considerable ground among patent practitioners    and national patent judges. [0]   the epla proposal was essentially dropped in 2007 after the legal service of european parliament issued an opinion that the epla would prima facie constitute a breach of article 292 of the ec treaty and thus the european community and its members states could not participate.

should be the next person in the line of succession who was : over the age of 21 , a british subject domiciled in the united kingdom , and capable of succeeding to the crown under the terms of the act

basis due to illness or absence abroad , two or more counsellors of state are appointed by letters patent to act in her majesty 's place . by law , counsellors of state include the sovereign 's spouse and the next four people in the line of succession who are over the age of 21. counsellors of state are authorised to carry out most of the official duties of the sovereign , for example , attending privy council meetings , signing routine documents and receiving the credentials of new ambassadors to the united kingdom . however , there are a number of core constitutional functions that may not be delegated : commonwealth matters the dissolving of parliament , except on her majesty 's express instruction the creation of peers appointing a prime minister history of counsellors of state the position of counsellor of state was provided for in 1937 under the terms of the regency act . prior to 1937 , regency acts were drafted and passed only in necessity . as such , there had been nine separate regency acts to cover various eventualities since 1728. shortly after george vi came to the throne in 1936 , a new regency act was passed which provided a rule for all future reigns

[ edit ] in late 1810 , king george iii was once again overcome by mental illness after the death of his youngest daughter , princess amelia . parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1789. without the king 's consent , the lord chancellor affixed the great seal of the realm to letters patent naming lords commissioners . such letters patent were irregular because they did not bear the royal sign manual , and only letters patent signed by the king himself can provide for the appointment of lords commissioners or for the granting of royal assent . however , because the king was already incapacitated de facto , resolutions by both houses of parliament approved the action and directed the lord chancellor to prepare the letters patent and to affix the great seal to them even without the signature of the monarch . the lords commissioners who were appointed in the name of the king signified the granting of the royal assent to a bill thar became the care of king during his

this demand is going to increasingly fall on prince william and the duchess of cambridge . being , in practice , the only available counsellor of state could conflict with these other demands . for example , there have been occasions when legislation urgently requires royal assent , such as when the parliamentary voting system and constituencies act 2011 required royal assent the very evening of its passage in the house of lords , and legislation relating to northern ireland has needed to be enacted quickly . there is a small , but genuine risk that that the non-availability of counsellors of state could impede the operation of the constitution . a further difficulty is that the acts appear to be predicated on the pre-existing common law position that at least two counsellors of state needed to act jointly . the acts state that the functions “ shall be exercised jointly ” , or “ by such number of them as may be specified in the letters patent ” .[SPLIT][title] Counsellor of State

counsellors of state are senior members of the british royal family to whom the monarch (elizabeth ii since 1952), can delegate and revoke royal functions through letters patent under the great seal , to prevent delay or difficulty in the dispatch of public business in the case of their illness (except total incapacity) or in their intended or actual absence from the united kingdom . [1]  counsellors of state may carry out "such of the royal functions as may be specified in the letters patent". [1]   in practice, this means most of the monarch's official duties, such as attending privy council meetings, signing routine documents and receiving the credentials of new ambassadors to the court of st james's . [2]   however, by law, counsellors of state cannot grant ranks, titles or peerages. [1]   they also, by the terms of the letters patent, cannot deal with a number of core constitutional functions, such as commonwealth matters, the dissolution of parliament (except on the monarch's express instruction) and the appointment of prime ministers . [2]   a rare example occurred on 7 february 1974 of the proclamation of the dissolution of parliament being promulgated by queen elizabeth the queen mother and princess margaret as counsellors of state, on the express instructions of queen elizabeth ii . [0]  royal functions are to be exercised jointly by the counsellors of state or by such number of them as is specified in the letters patent under the great seal and subject to any other conditions within. [3]   however, there is a legal presumption that counsellors of state should act jointly and, as such, at least two are needed to act, with the absence of one possibly risking a legal challenge.

[title] Chapbook [ref] [1]Europeana chapbooks share books were expensive in scotland between the 17th and 19th centuries . but literacy was comparatively high , and people were keen on reading . there was a large market for cheap , easy-to-get reading material : so-called street literature because it was simply sold on the streets . a popular type of street literature was chapbooks : small booklets of 8 , 16 or 24 ( and sometimes more ) pages , poorly printed on thin paper , covered with a paper wrapper and often adorned by crude woodcuts . they sold for a penny apiece . chapbooks contained songs , tales , children ’ s stories , history and news and formed the staple reading diet of the lower classes . chapbooks were sold by street criers , hawkers and itinerant pedlars , or chapmen . people also bought them at fairs , from the printers ’ shops , in pubs and even toy shops . for a penny , people could read the last words of an executed criminal , an account of a recent disaster , a garland of songs , or the history of famous heroes like william wallace , rob roy , nelson or napoleon . chapbooks were rarely read in silence . more often than not , they were read or sung aloud to an audience , which often included those who were illiterate .[SPLIT][title] Chapbook [ref] [2]peddler in england , these peddlers were known as “ manchester men. ” employed by a factory or

and this may have peaked in the decades just before the american civil war.however , their numbers began to decline by the 19th-century . advances in industrial mass production and freight transportation as a result of the war laid the groundwork for the beginnings of modern retail and distribution networks , which gradually eroded much of the need for travelling salesmen . the rise of popularmail order catalogues ( e.g . montgomery ward began in 1872 ) offered another way for people in rural or other remote areas to obtain items not readily available in local stores or markets . a relatively short-lived upsurge in the number of peddlers was witnessed in the period following the second world war , when the wartime manufacturing boom came to an abrupt end , and returning soldiers finding themselves unable to secure suitable work , turned to peddling which generally offered a decent income . in the united states , the travelling salesman became a stock character in countless jokes .[SPLIT][title] Chapbook [ref] [3]Spufford, Margaret retrieved 6 april 2014 . ^ spufford , margaret . `` people , land and literacy in cambridgeshire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

Definition and Origins" chapbooks : definition and origins a chapbook is `` a small book or pamphlet containing poems , ballads , stories , or religious tracts '' the term is still used today to refer to short , inexpensive booklets . the context i am using it in is that of the early modern period in england . chapbooks were small , cheaply produced books , most often octavo or duodecimo printings of twenty-four pages , sold without a cover . pamphlets were similar to chapbooks , but they can be divided by their content . pamphlets generally concerned matters of the day , such as politics , religion , or current events . chapbooks were timeless books of jest and tales that often sprang out of folklore . chapbooks were so called because they were sold by peddlers known as chapmen . chap comes from the old english for trade , so a chapman was literally a dealer who sold books . chapmen would carry boxes containing the conveniently sized editions , either in town on street corners , or traveling through the countryside . they typically sold their wares for twopence or threepence , and stocked a large variety of titles . among the types of content contained in chapbooks were romantic tales of chivalry , religious and moral instruction , cookbooks , guides to fortune telling and magic , and bawdy stories full of innuendo . chapmen traveled through england as early as the 1570s selling books to whoever they could .[SPLIT][title] Chapbook [ref][SPLIT] a chapbook is a small publication of up to about 40 pages, sometimes bound with a saddle stitch .in early modern europe a chapbook was a type of printed street literature . produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets , usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. [1]  they were often illustrated with crude woodcuts , which sometimes bore no relation to the text (much like today's stock photos ), and were often read aloud to an audience. [1]   when illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered popular prints .the tradition of chapbooks arose in the 16th century, as soon as printed books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries. many different kinds of ephemera and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as almanacs , children's literature , folk tales , ballads , nursery rhymes , pamphlets , poetry , and political and religious tracts .the term "chapbook" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. [0]  the corresponding french term is bibliothèque bleue (blue library) because they were often wrapped in cheap blue paper that was usually reserved as a wrapping for sugar. [0]   the german term is volksbuch (people's book). in spain they were known as pliegos de cordel (cordel sheets). [2][3]   in spain, they were also known as pliegos sueltos, which translates to loose sheets, because they were literally loose sheets of paper folded once or twice in order to create a booklet in quarto format.

[title] Unsimulated sex [ref] [1]the original '' i want the sex to have a very beautiful look , '' he said . there are those who are offended by the saccharine quality of the hollywood love scene , gauzy and backlit , choreographed like pas de deux . but if romantic , sentimental sex scenes might insult our intelligence or offend our aesthetics , they can be easier on the psyche than the sex in films like `` baise-moi , '' `` intimacy '' and `` romance , '' which is allowed to be sad , empty , desperate , banal , bleak , inevitable , stark , awkward , brightly lighted , depressing and truthful : sex that does not sweet-talk us at all . but it 's not easy finding actors who are willing to participate in a film in which the sex is `` real . '' while digital technology allows sex scenes to be filmed more privately , most actors have hangups about what they reveal on camera . mr. dumont and mr. von trier used doubles for scenes of penetration . ms. breillat hired the italian porn star rocco siffredi to play a long graphic sex scene in `` romance '' that other actors would n't . ms. despentes avoided the problem by choosing porn actresses for `` baise-moi '' from the start . when it comes to the messy truths about sex , we do n't necessarily want them too close to home .[SPLIT][title] Unsimulated sex [ref] [2]the original catherine breillat 's romance sensationally blurs the line between porn and art - she tells nicci gerrard why she believes you should see real sex on screen  more about romance watching a film about food does n't necessarily give one an appetite that needs satisfying . the food stays on the screen , distant from you and abstract ; you do n't get the warm smell of it rising under your nostrils , the taste of it . you do n't have to rush out of the room to get some of it for yourself , just as seeing one of cézanne 's beautiful apples does n't make you want to sink your teeth into the fruit . but if you watch a sexually explicit film , it is as if the bread on the screen had become the bread on your own table . you react not just with the mind but with the body . w.h . auden once said that the way to find out whether a work was pornographic was to show it to a male jury and ask them to stand up at the end - if their penises were unanimously erect , then it was . the point of an erotic or a pornographic film is to arouse . it has a physical purpose . it is problematic for a film to be both sexually explicit and artistic ; the one continually undermines the other .[SPLIT][title] Unsimulated sex [ref] [3]the original challenges to the system , changing cultural attitudes and liberalized , permissive morals brought about more evidences of nudity and sexuality in hollywood 's films as a result . also , once the theatres were forced to be sold off by the studios ( due in part to a 1948 ruling which forced the separation of the studios from their theatre chains ) , the owners had more choice in the selection of films , and the burgeoning growth of television brought further competition . expressive 'art-house ' films from europe brought the realization that sex in films meant greater profits . sex in cinema : ratings systems the development of ratings systems : more and more , with the loosening of standards and laissez-faire controls , graphic sexual scenes , criminality and violence , and coarse language were integrated into mainstream erotic films and dramas ( although it has often been demonstrated that erotica in films does n't necessarily guarantee greater box-office returns ) , although they ran the risk of being challenged . the motion picture industry officially abandoned the hays code in 1968. new voluntary ratings systems were proposed by the motion picture association of america , followed by age-based classification of films ( i.e. , g , m , r , x ) to protect children .[SPLIT][title] Unsimulated sex [ref] [4]"Porn Was Legalized 50 Years Ago, This Is How The Business Has Changed" as the new york times reported at the time : “ ‘ censorship in denmark ’ manages to display a lot of the product itself . there are still pictures , movies , a visit to the set of a porno film , live shows as they are being performed in porno clubs—all framed , and thus , apparently legally protected here , by the fact that this is , after all , a movie about pornography. ” cut to 2019 and the berlin porn film festival is gearing up for its 13th year , showing upwards of 100 adult movies across six days . it ’ s hard to gauge the size of today ’ s online porn industry—and it is notoriously difficult to crunch the numbers—but estimates range from $ 6 billion to $ 97 billion . so how did we get here ? `` pornography in denmark '' which was released in 1970. mike stabile de renzy ’ s wasn ’ t the only film to make waves that year . andy warhol ’ s controversial “ blue movie ” was also released in 1969 and was the first movie to show explicit “ real sex. ” like “ censorship in denmark ” it got away with its “ obscene ” content on account of being considered art . indeed , warhol is quoted in victor bockris ’ biography of him as saying : “ ‘ blue movie ’ was real .[SPLIT][title] Unsimulated sex [ref] [5]the original porn films preoccupied critics , cops and the courts . often financed by mafia families , they attracted the crusading instincts of local , state and federal prosecutors , who shut down the films and secured the conviction of one actor . they were directed by men who could fancy themselves as artists , and starred off-broadway actors as well as the occasional gifted ingenue like linda lovelace , star of the movie that created the craze ( and the phrase ) `` porno chic , '' deep throat . mainstream newspapers ( the timeses of new york and los angeles , the chicago sun-times ' roger ebert ) and magazines ( time and newsweek ) reviewed the more ambitious soft-core movies in the 60s and then hard-core , when it was legally exhibited . why ? because it was sufficiently dangerous , popular , newsworthy and , frequently , ambitious to warrant the interest of reviewers . the opinion of many of them , including me , was that there might be a meeting of pornography , which had quickly established a kind of artistic pedigree , and hollywood , which was striding toward explicit sexuality . that was also the belief of deep throat 's writer-director , gerard damiano , who said in 1973 : `` if it 's left alone , within a year sex will just blend itself into film . it 's inevitable . ''[SPLIT] in the film industry, unsimulated sex is the presentation of sex scenes in which actors genuinely perform the depicted sex acts , rather than simulating them. although it is ubiquitous in films intended as pornographic , it is very uncommon in other films. [1][2]   at one time in the united states such scenes were restricted by law and self-imposed industry standards such as the motion picture production code . [3]   films showing explicit sexual activity were confined to privately distributed underground films, such as stag films or "porn loops". in the 1960s, social attitudes about sex began to shift, and sexually explicit films were decriminalized in many countries. [4]  with movies such as blue movie by andy warhol , mainstream movies began pushing boundaries in terms of what was presented on screen. [5]   notable examples include two of the eight bedside-films and the six zodiac-films from the 1970s, all of which were produced in denmark and had many pornographic sex scenes, but were nevertheless considered mainstream films, all having mainstream casts and crews, and premiering in mainstream cinemas. [0]   the last of these films, agent 69 jensen i skyttens tegn, was made in 1978. from the end of the 1970s until the late 1990s it was rare to see hardcore scenes in mainstream cinema, but this changed with the success of lars von trier 's the idiots , which heralded a wave of art-house films with explicit content,    such as romance , baise-moi , intimacy , vincent gallo 's the brown bunny , and michael winterbottom 's 9 songs . some simulated sex scenes are sufficiently realistic that critics mistakenly believe that they are real, such as the cunnilingus scene in the 2006 film red road .
